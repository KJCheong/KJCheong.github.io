                    <p>Single-Turbo/Twin-Turbo/Twin-Scroll Turbo/Variable Geometry Turbo/Variable Twin Scroll Turbo/Electric Turbo but for the purpose of this I will be refering to single turbos</p>

                    <h1>What are Turbos for</h1>
                    <p>The main purpose of a turbocharger is to increase the volumetric efficiency of the combustion chamber. The compressor of the turbochargers is found using air from the atmosphere which is responsible for increasing the density through the rotation of impeller blade passages.</p>
                    <p>The turbine of the turbocharger is responsible for producing high back pressure on the exhaust manifold which results in the higher exhaust gas pressure as compared to the atmospheric pressure.</p>

                    <p>It helps ensure that your drive is safe and smooth by absorbing the energy from various road bumps and other kinetic impacts.</p>
